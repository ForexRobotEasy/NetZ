- `TakeProfit`: Take profit level for closing positions.
- `StopLoss`: Stop loss level for closing positions.

## Expert Advisor Functions

The code includes the following expert advisor functions:

### OnInit()
This function is called during initialization and is used to initialize necessary settings and resources. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if initialization is successful.

### OnTick()
This function is called on every tick and is used to check for trend reversal, calculate position size, open pending orders at optimal entry positions, and track and manage open positions.

### IsTrendReversal()
This function is used to check for trend reversal. It implements a trend reversal technique with modifications to accurately identify trend reversals. It returns `true` if trend reversal is identified, `false` otherwise.

### CalculatePositionSize()
This function is used to calculate the position size based on risk management parameters. It calculates the position size as a percentage of the account balance and returns the normalized position size.

### OpenPendingOrders(double positionSize)
This function is used to open pending orders at optimal entry positions. It implements virtual pending orders and uses a careful timing strategy to maximize profits. The position size parameter is used to determine the lot size of the pending orders.

### TrackOpenPositions()
This function is used to track and manage open positions. It implements stop loss and take profit features to manage risk effectively. It also adjusts the grid step size and closes partial losses when false reversals occur.

### OnDeinit(const int reason)
This function is called during deinitialization and is used to release any allocated resources.
